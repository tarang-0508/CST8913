Q-1 Describe how this application can be deployed in the cloud using IaaS infrastructure
ANS= Deploy the application in the cloud using IaaS infrastructure with separate Virtual Machines (VMs) for each component: one for the front end, one for the back end, and one for the database. For internal communication, create a secure network with subnets and open only the necessary ports, such as HTTP/HTTPS. Install Virtual Machines, set strong passwords, and configure regular backups.On the backend VM, install Python and use a production server like Gunicorn to run the Flask app. For the frontend VM, install Nginx to serve the built React app. Use a load balancer to split traffic between servers and ensure proper domain name resolution. Implement security measures such as SSH keys, firewalls, and other tools to keep your data secure.To handle increased user traffic, scale by adding more VMs and set up autoscaling to adjust traffic distribution automatically.

Q-2 Describe how this application can be deployed in the cloud using PaaS infrastructure.
Ans= Deploying this application using PaaS involves using cloud services to handle much of the heavy lifting for you. For the backend, you can use services like Azure App Service or AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which ensure your code runs smoothly while automatically managing the servers. For the React front end, platforms like Netlify or Azure Static Web Apps can host your static files and provide features like HTTPS and global content delivery. For the database, you can use a service like Google Cloud SQL or Amazon RDS, which eliminates the need to worry about installation, backups, or scaling. These platforms allow your application to connect securely to the database, and the front end communicates with Flask using environment variables for secure connections like SSL. From your code repository, you can set up automated deployments, making updates seamless.

Q-3 For each case, draw a diagram that represents the target architecture and describe each of the chosen cloud components.
