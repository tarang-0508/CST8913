1. Assess the Existing Architecture

Assessing the current architecture represents the starting point for successfully refactoring a monolithic web application. The assessment includes documenting complete application components and analyzing their connections to other elements and how they communicate.

1)Identify Monolithic Components:

The interface presents itself through web technology while receiving user commands.

The backend serves as the business logic layer that handles authentication functions, processes user input, and connects to the database.

The Database Layer functions with an SQL Server instance operating from the Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machine.

The system includes various batch operations along with scheduled maintenance tasks, including report creation and data cleaning routines.

2)Determine Dependencies and Interactions:

The examination focuses on detecting methods through which different layers transmit data, such as API communications and direct database requests.

Third-party software integration systems and external application programming interfaces (APIs) need to be identified.

The mapping of dependencies can be achieved through software tools, including Azure Migrate, Azure Service Map, and Application Insights.

+---------------------+       +-----------------------+
        |                             |
        v                             v
+--------------------+       +-------------------------+
|  Frontend (UI)     |<----->| Backend (Business Logic)|
+--------------------+       +-------------------------+
                                |
                                v
                       +---------------------+
                       | SQL Server (DB)    |
                       +---------------------+



2. Plan the Refactoring Strategy

The goal is to break the monolith into independent, scalable microservices and select suitable Azure services for each part.

1)Break Down the Monolith:

Separate the frontend and backend logic.

Identify independent features suitable for Azure Functions (e.g., email notifications, scheduled jobs).

2)Select Appropriate Azure Services:

Azure App Service: Host the web frontend and backend API for high availability and scaling.

Azure SQL Database: Replace the VM-hosted SQL Server with a fully managed database service.

Azure Functions: Convert background processes into serverless functions to reduce infrastructure management.

Azure Blob Storage: Store static files like images, logs, and backups.

3)Define an Authentication and Authorization Strategy:

Implement Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity management.

Use Managed Identity to securely access other Azure resources.



3. Implement Refactoring Changes

This phase focuses on executing the migration and refactoring plan.

Deploy the Frontend Using Azure App Service:
Establish both an Azure App Service plan and a web app.

Automate CI/CD functions through GitHub Actions with Azure DevOps.


Migrate the Database to Azure SQL Database:

Use Azure Database Migration Service to move the database schema and data contents between systems.

Modify the application configuration to update the connection strings.


Rephrase the Background Tasks into Azure Functions:

Establish a method for rewriting tasks that occur repeatedly or as events by deploying Azure Functions with specified triggers:

Timer Trigger: For scheduled processes.

Queue Trigger: For asynchronous background jobs.

HTTP Trigger: For API-based execution.


Store Static Content and Logs in Azure Blob Storage:

Begin by building a Storage Account along with a Blob Container.

Update the application to manage the storage and retrieval of static resources between server runs.



4. Optimize and Test

Testing combined with optimization procedures must be implemented to confirm the new architecture meets both performance benchmarks and reliability standards.

Implement Auto-Scaling:

Configure Azure App Service to scale operations based on CPU activity measurements and user traffic patterns.

Use Azure SQL Database Elastic Pools for efficient storage management to maintain workload performance while minimizing costs.


Configure Logging and Monitoring:

Ensure end-to-end observability by implementing Azure Monitor with Application Insights.

Set up alert systems to notify users of critical system breakdowns and poor system performance.


Test Application Performance and Reliability:

Perform load testing using Azure Load Testing.

Use Azure Chaos Studio to conduct fault simulations and test system resilience.
