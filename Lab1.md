Q-1 What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?
Ans= There are many motivators for companies to migrate to the cloud, but the most important ones are better teamwork and improved communication. The cloud allows teams to share essential documents and collaborate effectively, even while working remotely, using tools like Microsoft 365. It also boosts productivity, as employees can access data and documents from anywhere through cloud storage. Additionally, making smart decisions is crucial, and tools like IoT and advanced analytics help in this process. As the company grows, the cloud enables the scalability of storage to meet increasing demands.

Q-2 What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?
Ans= I want to understand the IT infrastructure, such as what kind of equipment and tools you are using right now, including hardware, software, networking, and storage. How do you track everything? How do you manage data for employees working remotely and ensure the security of personal and sensitive information, including farm-related data? How do you provide tech support and training to your employees, especially with new cloud tools? What are your big goals for the cloud in the future, such as using IoT, data analysis, or automating tasks?

Q-4 Describe the most likely migration approach that will suit the chosen company.
Ans= Assessment and planning are the starting points, where companies determine which services to move to the cloud first and which ones will take more time, especially considering internet issues. As the cloud grows, once one task is completed, the next step is to add new people or services, such as moving a file to cloud storage. Security is as important as the internet, especially during remote work. Remote employees require additional security measures like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to ensure safety.

Q-5 Produce a high level schedule for the migration process
Ans= The first phase is Assessment and Planning, which takes 1-2 months to create a detailed plan and begin with cloud services like Microsoft 365 and Azure. The milestone is to have a clear plan for migration. In the 3-5 month phase, cloud adoption takes place, and employees become familiar with Microsoft tools so they can work confidently. Hybrid cloud deployment occurs in the 6-9 month phase, where everything is connected to ensure seamless operation. Finally, the focus is on ensuring security and optimization, with the team continuously monitoring and improving the cloud setup and environment.

Q-6 What are the main decision criteria for the chosen company?
Ans= Security is essential for the safety of the company's sensitive data, especially since some employees are working remotely. It is important to ensure that the cloud storage is secure. Cost savings are also a major factor for companies, as they can save money by moving from on-site systems to cloud-based services. Scalability is necessary for systems that can grow with the business. Better collaboration is another key requirement, as cloud tools can support teamwork and enhance productivity. In case of another pandemic or similar crisis, the cloud is the best solution for enabling remote work.
